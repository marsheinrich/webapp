            (collectively, the &nbsp;ezClocker Software), agrees to be bound by these Terms and Conditions of Use, all
            applicable laws and regulations, and agrees to be responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. If
            You do not agree with any of these terms, You are prohibited from using or accessing the ezClocker Software.
            The materials contained in the ezClocker Software are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.</p>
        <h2>2. Use License</h2>
        <p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on
                the ezClocker Software for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of
                a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license You may not:
                <ol class="c9 lst-kix_list_1-1 start" start="1">
                    <li class="c11">modify or copy the materials or create derivative works therefrom;</li>
                    <li class="c11">use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>
                    <li class="c11">attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on the ezClocker Software;</li>
                    <li class="c11">remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>

                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>This license shall automatically terminate if You violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated

            to the information he/she submits/inputs via the ezClocker Software and that ezClocker cannot provide him/her
            with such information. Employer acknowledges that if ezClocker is served with a subpoena for such information

        <h2>5. Fees and Cancellation</h2>
        <p>
            Employers using the ezClocker Services agree to pay the fees (the Fees) set out on the ezClocker website, which may be increased
            from time to time upon 30 days&rsquo; notice. &nbsp;If an Employer has one employee or less, the Fees are
            waived. &nbsp;All Employers signing up will receive a free 30 day trial of the ezClocker Service that begins
            on the date the Employer signs up for the Service and ends on the 30
            <span class="c0 c5">th</span>
            <span class="c0">&nbsp;day thereafter (the Initial Trial Period). &nbsp;If an Employer does not cancel the Service before
                the end &nbsp;of &nbsp;the Initial Trial Period, it will be charged and agrees to pay the Fees. &nbsp;Fees
                will be billed to the credit card on file. &nbsp;After the Initial Trial Period, the Service will renew
                automatically every 30 days unless canceled. &nbsp;The Services may be canceled at any time. &nbsp;All
                cancellations will be effective as of the next 30 day renewal date. &nbsp;There are no refunds for partial
                30 day periods. Please refer to the ezClocker website for instructions on how to cancel the Service.
                &nbsp;Generally, if you have subscribed to the Service using Apple iTunes or Google Play you will need
                to access those sites to cancel the Service and links to those sites are available on the ezClocker mobile
                application.
