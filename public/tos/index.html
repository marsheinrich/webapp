        </p>
        <p class="ezLeftMargin_20">
            (d) to instruct each employee to check his/her time records for accuracy on the

            3. Ownership of Information
        </h3>
        <p>
            All data input into the ezClocker Software is owned by the employers that use the ezClocker Software
            (Employers or Employer) and not by employees (similar to employee timesheets, which are owned by an
            employer and not an employee). Any employee using the ezClocker Software acknowledges and understands
            that he/she has no right to the information he/she submits/inputs via the ezClocker Software directly
            from ezClocker and that ezClocker cannot provide him/her with such information as this information is
            the property of the Employer. Employer acknowledges that if ezClocker is served with a subpoena for such
            information it must comply as required by applicable law. Notwithstanding the above, an employee will
            have access to view and copy (via email by the employee to the employee) records of his/her timesheets
            via the ezClocker Software while the employee is an authorized user.

            4. Opt-in
        </h3>
        <p>
            By accepting these terms and conditions You agree that ezClocker may communicate with You at any time
            regarding Your account and that ezClocker may send other communications to You, including newsletters
            and surveys. You will have the option of unsubscribing from the latter, but not the former.
        </p>
        <h3>
            5. Fees and Cancellation
        </h3>
        <p>
            Employers using the ezClocker Services agree to pay the fees (the Fees) set out on the ezClocker
            website, which may be increased from time to time upon 30 days notice. If an employer has one employee
            or less, the fees are waived. All Employers signing up will receive a free 30-day trial of the ezClocker
            Service that begins on the date the Employer signs up for the Service and ends on the 30 days thereafter
            (the Initial Trial Period). If an Employer does not cancel the Service before the end of the Initial
            Trial Period, it will be charged and agrees to pay the Fees. Fees will be billed to the credit card on
            file. After the Initial Trial Period, the Service will renew automatically every 30 days unless
            canceled. The Services may be canceled at any time. All cancellations will be effective as of the next
            30-day renewal date. There are no refunds for partial 30-day periods. Please refer to the ezClocker
            website for instructions on how to cancel the Service. Generally, if you have subscribed to the Service
            using Apple iTunes or Google Play you will need to access those sites to cancel the Service, and links
            to those sites are available on the ezClocker mobile application.
